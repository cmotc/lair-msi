# lair-msi
Repository to separate the insane logic of building an MSI file from my sources.

This repository is where you can get msi packages for testing releases of LAIR
for Windows. For those of you who don't know what msi packages are, it's the
thing that installs a program on Windows. If you want to try out my video game
on Windows, you'll need one of the following:

  * [64 Bit Intel/Windows](https://github.com/cmotc/lair-msi/raw/master/lair-x64.msi)
  * [32 Bit Intel/Windows](https://github.com/cmotc/lair-msi/raw/master/lair-x86.msi)

Both versions of the installer will install both the 32 and 64 bit versions of
the game, but the 32 bit version will create a shortcut to the 32 bit
application, and the 64 bit version will create a shortcut to the 64 bt
application.
